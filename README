I know this assignment is nowhere near correct, but I've deleted everything and restarted and still can't figure it out. I'm not sure if I'm just not understanding LESS, but none of the code I was using was working or making any changes. The only thing that was changing was my H2 with the .heading variable.

I understand I probably can't get credit for any of this, but I wanted to submit something because I did spend a lot of time trying to make it work.
